## Netlify Deployment

To deploy on Netlify with the included configuration:

1. Push this repository to a Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
2. In Netlify, create a new site from Git and choose this repository.
3. Netlify reads `netlify.toml`, installs pnpm automatically, and runs `pnpm build` to publish the `.next` directory.
4. Trigger a deploy from the main branch; later pushes build automatically.

The included `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` dependency enables full Next.js 14 features (app router, middleware, image optimization) on Netlify.
